<p>Sometimes, my verses fall like fishes. Other times, they fly like startled birds. Nearly always,
they reflect bits and bobs of my lived experiences. Whether I attempt to associate with besties or
with strangers, I’ve discovered that strong encounters influence the ways in which I manipulate
words. Even weak happenstances help me deploy a range of rhetorical flavors.</p>

 <p>

<p>As such, this collection of poems and images, <em>Word Magpie</em>, proffers multiple tastes. Please
sip these pieces. Enjoy their explications of sapidity. Pour yourself a figurative decafe or brew an
actual cup of tea. Put your feet up. Apparate from your conceptual pantry to mine. Jointly, we’ll
sample cultural concoctions whose zips have been sufficiently simmered as to be mostly
distilled.</p>

 

<p>Since society’s activities will forever connect us to each other in ways both propitious and
inauspicious, it’s beneficial to swig together. We are the communal heirs of tasty as well as
unsavory ideologies. Let’s drink up!</p>
