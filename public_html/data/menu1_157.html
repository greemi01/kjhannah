Parenting is both a natural and an acquired trait. On the one hand, adults seek to be, if not
"perfect," then "ideal" nurturers of children. On the other hand, the complexities of raising
children often cause care providers to adjust role expectations and to neglect other duties.

<p>From overflowing diapers to adolescent dilemmas, from inter-sibling sauciness to the surrender of
careers for reasons of focusing days and nights on wee darlings, and from the joy of discovering
that progeny are emerging as lawyers, environmentalists, bankers, and clerics,
all <em>before </em>naptime, to the alarming revelation that some of those same sons and daughters
are aspiring (gasp!) to become writers, parenting enriches. It's of no small consequence that after
years of being peed on, spit up upon, and drooled over, moms and dads graduate to emotional
meltdowns, dramatic accusations, and plain ‘ol funk. Parenting is an uneven process.</p>
<p>In validation, <em>Mothers Ought to Utter Only Niceties</em> illuminates the throes of raising
infants, children, teens, and young adults. This poetry collection documents parents as they wibble,
wobble, fall down, and start all over again, while concurrently urging their boys and girls to grow
up. Accordingly, this book reveals "How the Next Generation Succumbed to the End of Morality," why
kids are often found with "Frozen Green Beans on Their Faces," and how difficult, familial moments
can wrap well if only care providers hold to "Simple Miracles" or make a point of disregarding
"Jukebox Juries."</p>

<p>Sure, at times, broods leave parents "Empty of Meaningful Intelligence," "Social Evolutions"
makes parents unwilling censors of children's information byways, and all of that fuss over the next
generation causes parents to forget their "Brandy and Cheer," and "Pillow Talk's Expediency."
Fortunately, most moms and dads eventually stay awake long enough to return to that which brought
about parenthood and eventually are again well served by their partners' "Hushed, Stealthy Looks."
Even with boom boxes blearing, lamps crashing, and children elsewise acting childish, most adults
learn to stop worrying about "Keeping Hedgehogs Trim via Liberal Politics," "Plastic Surgery," and
"Reckoning with Trauma."</p>
<p>Parents are fortunate of folks. In seventy earnest bites, <em>Mothers Ought to Utter Only Niceties</em> rightly celebrates their amazingly vacillating universe.</p>
