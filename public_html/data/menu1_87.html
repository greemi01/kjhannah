<p>Songbirds are entertaining. Roses smell nice. Most passion, however, resolves as cacophonous and stinky. In <em>A Bank Robber's Bad Luck with His Ex-Girlfriend,</em> this mess, to which love often gets reduced, is poked at, is prodded a lot, and is eventually pushed over. Whereas money might buy all manners of dalliance, and fame might catapult a person past social mores, a good, strong kick, such as is offered in <em>A Bank Robber's Bad Luck with His Ex-Girlfriend</em>, can most successfully level the difference between interpersonal "decency" and liaisons' impropriety.</p>
<p>To wit, <em>A Bank Robber's Bad Luck with His Ex-Girlfriend</em> employs a mixture of contemporary and traditional forms, including <em>ae freislighae</em>, ballad, <em>cyrch a chutas</em>, and free verse, as it proffers the tang of real or imagined, but almost always piquant, romantic life. First love, serial marriages, fidelity, adultery, crushes, callous calculations, and much more are explicated in this collection's unabashed adjudication of relationships.</p>
<p>Concurrently tough, sassy, and hopeful, this book strives to press up against soft concepts of intimate associations. Articulated regrets, muted longings, and rudimentary joy all slide among these pages. From the initial poem, "A Bankrobber's Bad Luck with His Ex-Girlfriend," to the concluding verse, "Hurt is to Healing," this volume gives readers images and language with which to wrestle with affection's important, awkward and contested moments.</p>
<p>Whereas you might be tempted to forgo all further human experiments in favor of cloistering yourself with an imaginary hedgehog or whereas you might find it easier to pretend that all is right with your current situation than to redefine your personal boundaries, allow <em>A Bank Robber's Bad Luck with His Ex-Girlfriend</em> to help you own your volitions. It might be imprudent to act otherwise.</p>
