<p>When the world's most original thinkers get stymied, humanity
  suffers. Our poverty of inspired and enterprising insights
  ultimately frustrates civilization. Specifically, such a dearth
  thwarts society’s hope for reparation and growth, and, more
  generally, impedes its ability to move past any inherent
  dysfunction. Sadly, because most of our assemblages of words and
  most of our collections of images succumb to false beliefs about
  limits on the nature and kind of individuals’ pathways for
  communication, we artists are not necessarily helping matters.</p>

<p>Since it’s not through fissuring, but through association that we
  can improve the social order, it’s important for us producers to
  find ways to use our faculties in interchange. Sure, it’s useful,
  even essential, to have primary strengths, yet, simultaneously, it’s
  useful, even essential, to manifest support for our less utilized
  forms of expression. Namely, creative folks need to actualize their
  potential beyond their specialties. </p>

<p>Accordingly, One-Handed Pianist means to serve as a catalyst for
  additional imaginative efforts. People become willing to seek
  favorable outcomes in uncertain domains after they've evidenced
  others doing so. “See one, do one, teach one.” By exemplifying the
  value of crossing over into new types of dialogue, One-Handed
  Pianist can help artists move beyond their inventive comfort
  zones.</p>

<p>This book contains one hundred pairs of poems and digital
  paintings, all of which were generated by me, an individual
  primarily considered a “writer.” My journey into the realm of visual
  work is meant to encourage other artists to take risks, to avow
  talent's multidimensional quality, and to exemplify ways in which
  all originators can grow. </p>
