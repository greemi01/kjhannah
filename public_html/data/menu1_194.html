<p>Australia’s settlers were criminals. America’s were religious
  dissonants. Israel’s are visionaries. In this Holy Land of the
  Kotel, of elevated highways, of ultraorthodox communities, of
  international outsourcing, of dumpster cats, of pocket-sized home
  appliances, and of flustered elementary school teachers, dwell: the
  middle-aged man with leather fringe on his vest and a refurbished
  motorcycle between his thighs, the fat woman, who smiles at all
  onlookers as she walks by in short shorts, and the youth with the
  shaven head, who collects tattoos faster than a beachcomber gathers
  shells.</p>

<p>Israel’s population speaks Hebrew, English, Arabic, Russian, and
  French; tolerates darting lizards and Old City cab drivers; and
  assigns authority to the decibel of “amens.” People of many kinds
  exist in splendid comportment here, together attaching meaning to
  this nation’s sky-filled vistas and crowded buses.</p>

<p>Living in Israel means embracing multiculturalism, joining in the
  entire complement of lifecycle events, and easing up on demographic
  strictures. Although immigrants bring their particularities to this
  place of sand and sun, Israel pours an even greater depth of
  character into her newcomers. It remains important, here, to
  differentiate among: modes of gesturing, ways of bargaining, and
  avenues for seeking children’s spouses. Few geographies proffer
  vastness to parking tickets, dentists, or ethnic fierceness,
  concurrent with ascribing significance to aureate sunsets.</p>

<p>In Israel, where existence is at once challenging, invigorating,
  and serendipitous, the populace exists as a single, grand troop
  while marking Torah holidays, caring for orphans and widows, or
  donating to charities. Any particular fondness for manufactured
  goods continues on as trivial here, an altitude where skin tone,
  political leanings, and secular education have limited
  relevance.</p>

<p>Local dwellers deconstruct “Israeli” via silly, self-effacing
  rhetoric, via book smarts, and via native wit or wisdom. No mode
  reveals the entirety of this “neighborhood’s” mysteries, but all
  states of being yield glimpses into her special truth. This ancient,
  spiritual realm’s golden hills and limestone-faced buildings hold
  fast to abundant certainties. It’s not so much that these facades
  are unwilling to yield accurate, deep understandings as it is that
  we human vessels lack the wherewithal to contain such
  profundity. </p>

<p>Accordingly, in fifty essays, <em>On Golden Limestone</em> glances
  at Israeli’s people, their communication, their day-to-day
  goings-on, and their momentous occasions. Although this book
  promises only hints of perspicacity, the small gleanings it proffers
  should be embraced. Please join me in this textual exploration of
  several facets of the world’s greatest treasure.</p>
