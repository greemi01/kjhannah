<p>In seventy literary bites, <em>Sweet and Sour: Womanly Thoughts</em> invites
readers to explore the complex roles of females. This book celebrates
moms’ ability to simultaneously: mop carpets, diaper doll bottoms,
chop beans, and actualize professional jobs. As well, this book
regards, jadedly, some of the conventions surrounding womenfolk’s
socially prescribed limits.</p>

<p>This assemblage is meant to be provocative. It is a collection of
frankly noisy notions at the same time as it is a rationale for
ordering more chips and dips, for triaging one’s inflatable swimming
pools, and for weighing the utility of <em>papier-mâché</em> parrots. <em>Sweet and
Sour: Womanly Thoughts</em> makes readers scold their supervisors while
simultaneously wishing to be elsewhere, hugging their children. It is
a peppery itch without the relief of a rub. Above all, this assemblage
is an invitation to engage in critical thinking.</p>

<p><em>Sweet and Sour: Womanly Thoughts</em> intentionally stomps around
uncomfortable topics, dares to engage, to enrage, and to otherwise
trigger emotions. For instance, this work describes The Middle East’s
history of disputed real estate with the same nonchalance with which
it refers to the availability of affordable, herbal
galactagogues. What’s more, <em>Sweet and Sour: Womanly Thoughts</em> as
readily bemoans excessive teen energies as it does adults’
over-reliance on electronic devices. Basically, this book does not shy
away from prickly positions and it does not recoil from edifying
ones. <em>Sweet and Sour: Womanly Thoughts</em> shovels collective cow dung
into double dug rows for the express purpose of agitating, viz., for
the express purpose of catalyzing new questions.</p>
