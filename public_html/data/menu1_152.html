<p>No matter the virtue that we possess, it remains true that even the most empowered among us can benefit from greater attachment to The Boss and from greater appreciation of Creation. One dimension of Creation is time and one dimension of time is the exacting portions, which we call months, weeks, and days.</p>
<p>Among those divisions are holidays and Shabbot. Our seasons cycle accordingly.</p>
<p>Those cycles, in turn, have the power to loosen us from harmful paradigms and to nudge us along the road of righteous living.</p>
<p>Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Sukkot, Chanukah, Purim, Pesach, Yom Hazikaron, Yom Ha’atzmaut, Tish B’Av and Shabbot, all, in their unique ways, potentially move us toward higher levels of connection to Hashem and of connection to each other.</p>
<p><em>Jerusalem Sunrise: Veracious Celebrations</em> marks that influence. This book’s sixty essays offer a textual recapitulation of the main musics of those aforementioned portions of time, whether it’s the cleaning of our souls that takes place alongside of our chasing away dust bunnies and bread crumbs, before Pesach, or whether it’s the cleaning of our hearts that takes place during Elul, before the Yomim Noraim.</p>
<p>Such melodies, it is hoped, enhance our existent perspectives on faith and hope, and allow us to enact our Avodas Hashem joyfully. In the least, these snippets of celestial awareness, caught modestly in the form of motherly musings, honor the sanctity of the Jewish holidays.</p>
