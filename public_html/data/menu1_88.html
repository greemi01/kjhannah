<p>There is much to be gleaned from anthropomorphic tales populated
with spacelings, with anxiety-prone rabbits, and with literate
penguins. By placing our moral onus on hairy or on scaly beings, like
the ones populating <em>Don't Pet the Sweaty Things</em>, we humans
can safely poke at occupational hazards, relationship foibles, and
never-actualized bucket lists.</p>

<p>More specifically, by reading about sentient hedgehogs, biker
lizards, and intergalactic entrepreneurs, we can cautiously stretch
our considerations of how we treat ourselves and others. It's less
daunting to cheer on warring sugar ants than to confront a boss, to
hope for the success of a Tuna Olympics contender than to give advice
to an adolescent child, and to think up salutations for a space cowboy
than to properly word a greeting to a new neighbor.</p>

<p>The stories in this assemblage include ones in which brave, spiky
mammals face down fuzzy adversaries, postpartum tree hoppers work out
libido problems, multi-headed creatures affect Earth's economies,
couch potatoes realize our lack of preparedness for alien attack, and
juvenile chimera chicks illuminate our cultural prejudices. Simply,
the critters in this book are as fond of gulping down social codes as
they are of devouring people. Accordingly, as these beasts scoot
across these pages, they teach us a little about self care and a lot
about heroes not always having to be ethically superior or physically
superlative. They leave trails of slime, too.</p>

<p>Reading damp, modern fiction, such as is exemplified by <em>Don't
Pet the Sweaty Things'</em> contained works, can help us grasp how to
defeat the monsters within ourselves simultaneous with helping us cope
with the ones we meet. This collection of outlandish musings gets us
to reach beyond personal turpitudes, while still making for a night's
entertainment.</p>
