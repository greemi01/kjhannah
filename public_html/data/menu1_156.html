<p>
I am not young, pretty or skinny. What I am is a midlife mom with ample attitude. I love wonky
characters and farfetched plots. Much to the chagrin of editors, who read manuscripts blind, I'm
not, as accused, either a clone of Russell Kirk or of Edmund Burke. I don't live in North America
and I'm not possessed of an MFA.
</p>

<p>More to the point, I spend long tracks of time in my
housecoat. Additionally, I openly yearn for fresh water fish with
which to engage in experiments and for vials full of concentrated tea
tree oil with which to measure the potential energy in my family's
reactions to my aquatic research. I believe that "mass times
acceleration squared" brings results. You see, I'm wonky, except for
bad days when I'm full out weird.</p>

<p>Accordingly, my writing is topped off with reminders about
childhood viscidities when it is not otherwise redolent with
adolescent angst. "Wet" and "sticky" work for me. It continues on, in
my humble view, that grownup perspectives on truth remain lacking.</p>

<p>So, I package my far flying ideas and market them to all varieties
of literary salons. "Bizarro" sits cheek to check with "fine fiction"
on my bibliography. What's more, I retain a sweet spot for venues that
encourage readers to gawk at two-headed wildebeests, imaginary, but
ever so visible, hedgehogs sporting snow glasses, and the occasional
gelatinous monster. Reading a page of my expanded text means finding
one's self in blackberry fields featuring candy cane trees or in
highlands where chimeras nest.</p>

<p>For those reasons, settle in, enjoy an ambulance's warmth, a
strange citizen's defeated attempts to bake a souffl√©, and the gluey
texture of love, which is manifested by a man, in turn, besotted with
a woman, who resists complying with "pre-emptive, harm-reducing,"
federal laws on flawlessness. If you relax just a tad, you'll be
entertained by the tales found in <em>Cryptids</em>.</p>
