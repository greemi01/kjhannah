In the 1980s, KJ Hannah Greenberg served as a respondent at scholarly conferences and wrote for
scholarly periodicals. She also served on the staff of <em>Three Rivers Poetry Journal</em>. In the
1990s, she left academia to parent her sons and daughters, all of whom took the requisite decades to
become adults. During that span, Hannah was too busy to contemplate her navel. Add to that mix four
grandbabies, and it seemed dubious that she’d ever proceed in a straightforward manner per
left-field scrivening.
</p>

<p>
  If, during that phase, Hannah had had five more minutes, she would have baked quinoa pie and fed
  it to her imaginary hedgehogs. Instead, she made do with stealing sleep and laughter. Besides, on
  rare, alternate Tuesdays, Hannah and her furz-pigs flew the galaxy in search of adventures.
</p>

<p>
  More exactly, three decades ago, while focused on her children,
  Hannah eked out: a novel, a ream of poetry, and a couple of cute,
  nonfiction pieces that referenced the “growth opportunities”
  concomitant to parenting. However, Hannah stashed those treasures
  instead of finessing them because she was too preoccupied mopping
  carpets, diapering doll bottoms, and chopping beans.  Meanwhile, to
  distract herself from unpleasant motherhood moments, she taught
  calculus to high school students and conducted university classes in
  Argumentation and Debate, Interpersonal Communication, and Feminist
  Sociology (Hannah holds both a B.S. in Technical [Science] Writing
  and Editing from Carnegie-Mellon University and a Ph.D. in Rhetoric
  from The University of Massachusetts.)
</p>

<p>
  When, in 2005, Hannah and her family relocated to “the other side of
  the world,” her life changed. Specifically, upon entertaining some
  female friends with a tall tale about falafel balls, preteen fashion
  sense, and “special American pricing,” Hannah was told to keep her hot
  sauce to herself, to realign her skirt, and to return to knocking out
  narratives.
</p>

<p>
  A multi-year stint blogging about intercultural communication, for The
  <em>Jerusalem Post</em>, followed as did a few months of teaching
  chemistry. Simultaneously, Hannah made the discovery that local,
  dumpster cats are really “squirrels.” What’s more, she edited a paper,
  for the Weizmann Institute, on the effects of electrical stimulus on
  the hippocampus, and diffidently wrote a handful of stories for venues
  like <em>Mishpacha’s Calligraphy</em> and <em>Mid-century Modern Moms</em>. Withal, she
  bought a pair of very large earrings, judged nonfiction for <em>Notes &
  Grace Notes</em>, became “Poet of the Week” at <em>Poetry Super Highway</em> and
  established Expressively Yours Writing Workshops.
</p>

<p>
  During the summer of 2008, ultimately frustrated with her inability to
  lecture locally on discourse (her Hebrew was lacking), Hannah
  rededicated her verbal zest to distant points. Specifically, she
  dusted off her keyboard and began to churn out more smoothies,
  vegetable soup, and original works than might be considered proper for
  a middle-aged mom.
</p>

<p>
  By 2009, Hannah began blogging for the USA’s <em>Type-A Parent</em>, began
  penning a column for the UK’s <em>The Mother Magazine</em>, began serving as a
  nonfiction and poetry Associate Editor at <em>Sotto Voce</em> and as an
  Associate Editor of short and flash fiction for <em>Bewildering Stories</em>. She
  received her first Pushcart Prize nomination that year for her poem
  “Faltering in Ways Uncharted.”
</p>

<p>
  2010 found Hannah formulating monthly critiques of short stories,
  novelettes and novellas for <em>Tangent</em>, the speculative fiction review,
  and blogging for Australia’s <em>Kindred</em>. That year, likewise, French
  Creek Press published <em>Oblivious to the Obvious: Wishfully Mindful
    Parenting</em>, a collection of Hannah’s humorous essays.

  In 2011, Hannah edited short and flash fiction for <em>Bound Off</em>, began a

  Prize nomination for her poem, “Apple,” and celebrated the publication
  of another poetry collection, <em>A Bank Robber’s Bad Luck with His
  Ex-Girlfriend</em>, by UnboundCONTENT.

  Pet the Sweaty Things</em>, a flash and short story collection, by Bards &

  published by Aldrich Press. Plus, the first edition of <em>The Immediacy
  of Emotional Kerfuffles</em>, a flash and short story collection, was
  printed by Bards & Sages Publishing. Hannah was nominated for the
  Million Writers Award for her short story, “Defense,” and was
  nominated, for a third time, for the Pushcart Prize, for her poem
  “Silver Moss Fingers.” Additionally, Hannah brought her workshops to
  the OU Israel Center in Jerusalem, began to facilitate annual
  retreats, taught an advanced course in book writing and publishing,
  and began to teach remotely.

    Life in Jerusalem</em>, an essay collection, by Tailwinds Press. Character

  were among the remote courses that she taught. Hannah’s story, “Grit,”
  granted her a fourth nomination for a Pushcart Prize and her tale,
