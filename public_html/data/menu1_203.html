<p>Relationships are blessedly commonplace. The manner in which each of us carries out negotiating, maintaining (and possibly dissolving) our connections, however, is bespoken. Consider that many communication scholars flounder when social climbing, and that many politicians, as well as other individuals possessed of great applied communication skills, tend to mess up romantic and familial links. What's more, most of us become so obsessed with the ways in which external points define us that we neglect our vital, intrapersonal comings and goings.</p>
<p>Rudiments explores much of this fuss. It jabs at the ways and means by which we coordinate our management of meaning with the conflicting voices in our heads and with the folks with whom we are involved. That is, this collection of poetry investigates how we get along with ourselves. It also investigates how we get along with others. While this book might romance the notion of sticking together, this book, simultaneously, makes no pretense that all liaisons are good; Rudiments espouses that some of our affiliations adversely impact our well-being.</p>
<p>To wit, while we struggle to reify ourselves over and again, sometimes, we succeed in making sense out of ourselves, and, sometimes, we succeed in making sense out of our associations with other people. Other times, we fail. Nonetheless, whenever we appreciate ourselves or our couplings, we discover that each amalgamation of cognitions and feelings are dissimilar. Hence, it's our distinct modes of handling self-talk and of handling conversations that ought to get celebrated. Rudiments strives to honor these particularities.</p>
