<p><em>Upon the Lion and the Serpent</em> helps to illuminate the
Israeli perspective on current Middle Eastern and European Crises.
This novel tells of the struggles of disparate family members in the
context of our imperfectly unified nation. Included in this tale are:
settlers hurt by terrorists, grandparents stymied by aging, the
temptations of worldly values and their consequential path to
financial misfortune, and the trials of a young adult, who is suddenly
impacted by severe disability.</p>

<p>This book employs no gentling words, but rather gives over
characters that pull "their hearts out of their bodies and hold them
suspended" or who flaunt murderous knives “ornamented with silver
grips and flakes of blood." In <em>Upon the Lion and the Serpent</em>,
a widow is someone “not yet accustomed to the permanently vacant place
on the other side of her bed," a mentally ill lady is someone sitting
on the floor hugging herself, and a philosophically distraught
individual is a man pulled between loyalty to his people and his
personal needs.</p>

<p><em>Upon the Lion and the Serpent</em> depicts beauty not as the
stuff of makeup and of couture, but of alpine flowers and pinecone
dolls, of children who stack bathroom towels neatly, and of friends
who remember to call back. While the Galil’s red cyclamen and the sky
blue doors of Tsfat color these pages, the most fantastic natural
spectacle, here, is the eight-year old that weighs fibbing against
chocolates.</p>

<p>A palpable account of human complexity and growth, <em>Upon the
Lion and the Serpent</em> blends feet-on-the-ground reality with
head-in-the-Heavens idealism, all the while making it tough for
readers to simply hate or to blindly laud certain elements of
society. On the one hand, the protagonists, the Grunsteins, organize
charity drives and learning programs, walk with pride through a loud
gauntlet of anti-Semites, and serve on neighborhood committees. On the
other hand, they burn their toast, misplace their house keys, and talk
to light bulbs. Some of them fail to wait for clearance when bombs are
dropping. Others negotiate tee-shirt diapers, rationed toilet paper,
and hungry, stressed-out kids. These players, like most of us, are
intermittently funny and tragic.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the Grunsteins’ tests and their responses to those
difficulties help to make readers more mindful of their own challenges
and of their own gifts. While not all members of this book’s audience
will enjoy the reward of a new bride, or of friends reclaiming their
heritage, and while not all readers will suffer the cultural
assimilation of loved ones, or the slow progress toward death of their
matriarchs, all will be able to use <em>Upon the Lion and the
Serpent</em> as a place from which to begin the journey of clarifying
life’s treats and troubles.</p>
