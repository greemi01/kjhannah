<p>There are stranger creatures in our supermarkets, office parks, and libraries than ever roamed the woods or swam the seas. <em>Beast There—Don’t That</em> explores the nature and identity of some of these critters and cautions us, when necessary, to avoid or at least to give wide berth to them.</p>
