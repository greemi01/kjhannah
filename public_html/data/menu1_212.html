<p><em>Owmapow Rides Again</em><br>
Fomite Press, USA.<br>
Jan 2, 2022.  Buy it <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Owmapow-Rides-Again-Hannah-Greenberg/dp/195323660X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1MASI4SH0RDH5&keywords=owmapow+rides+again&qid=1640265625&sprefix=owmapow+rides+again%2Caps%2C208&sr=8-1'>here</a>.</p>

<p>Dr. Owen Brownstone, aka Owmapow, is a good-hearted fellow, a
biology professor, a rescuer of oceanic fauna, a devoted brother, a
teacher of science writing, and a wannabe fictioneer. Unfortunately,
he is also an individual who is almost always disadvantaged by the
courses of action in which he or his associates engage.</p>

<p>Yet, part of what makes him endearing is his tenacity. This
  character repeatedly attempts to embrace activities that he deems
  correct, no matter the number and nature of deterrents that they
  present. On balance, despite his innate courage, he repeatedly
  blunders. Dr. Brownstone remains a man befuddled by sundry
  ineptitudes, i.e., he is a contemporary Sad Sack, a relatively
  inconsequential person who is constantly confronting absurdities,
  even humiliations.</p>

<p>
As such, Owmapow is all of us. He is us in his doggedness. He is us in
his recurrently unexpected misfortune. He is us in his bumbling. For
every moment that any of us have felt incompetent or frustrated by the
caprices of empowered others or by the fickleness of providence, we
have been Owen Brownstone.
