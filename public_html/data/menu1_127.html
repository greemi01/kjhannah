<p><em>Intelligence's Vast Bonfires<br>
 </em>Lazarus Media. USA.<br>
December, 2012.</p>

<p>It is insufficient either to be the next widget writer, or, at the other extreme, to struggle to please academic champions. Living verse
necessarily has to gambol past imaginary hedgehogs chowing on jelly-filled doughnuts, beyond the strictures of high ranking scholastic
trolls, and into the rainbow abysses found only in rural, secret places. Successful poetry must simultaneously hamper mundanity and shun the
use of thick words.</p>

<p>Within <em>Intelligence's Vast Bonfires</em>, jeremiads sit alongside of celebrations, and announcements of scientific discoveries make
friends with samples of more exotic arts. Forays into civilian disobedience are illuminated, here, next to stanzas that toady hegemonic
strictures. Praise, flash, and glory are housed, as well, adjacent to the fetid trenches of convergent marketing efforts.</p>

<p>Accordingly, <em>Intelligence's Vast Bonfires</em> concurrently beams worshipful and cheeky, touches on commonplaces as well as on
specialized topics, and freely makes use of motes both odd and ordinary. What's more, this compilation makes no apologies, even between the
lines, for phrases which strive to be fully corporeal or for literary devices which are functionally more magic than median.</p>

<p>Imaginative writings, despite protests to the contrary, given linguistic limitations, must mirror, at least partially: the
social-political places to which their creators have traveled, the interpersonal negotiations in which their creators have involved
themselves, and the difficult pecuniary decisions which their creators have made. It remains ineluctable that poetry, including the pieces
assembled here, can not otherwise be brought into existence.</p>
