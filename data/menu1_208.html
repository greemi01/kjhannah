<p>It’s better to attach life experiences to poems than to let them
  fly high and out of sight. Literature worth resources speaks to our
  guts. More specifically, when groupings of words, like these one
  hundred instances in <em>Flames and Fire</em>, make us feel
  uncomfortable, we’re on to something good. Writing’s ability to
  interact with our viscera can save us, or, in the least, can
  shepherd us toward achieving vital goals.</p>

<p>Whereas it’s hardly useful to lark about, perusing worlds where
  venomous wildebeests run amok or where two-headed hedgehogs rule,
  it’s equally ineffective to stay closeted while attempting to
  legitimize the entirety of civilization. We might not be able to be
  friends with everyone, but we should, in general, manifest a little
  understanding and a lot of tolerance. Accordingly, the questions
  raised by the poems in <em>Flames and Fire</em> are important.</p>

<p>More exactly, this assemblage puts forth the idea that each of us,
  individually, and all of us, collectively, ought, immediately, to
  take accountability for our culture’s choices. This book further
  suggests that whether we are in the social minority or in the
  majority, our vociferations make a difference.</p>

<p>On balance, neither leaders nor insurgents can synthesize communal
  harmony where personal or public views emphasize contrast. Sadly,
  our protracted hunt for incommensurabilities creates the type of
  strife that leads to riots, government brutality, and terrorism. We
  win only when we look upon each other favorably. Hence, at the same
  time as we follow the trajectories of our individual stations, we’re
  helped by concurrently looked right and left toward other folks’
  situations. Forbearance is great; nonetheless, it’s smiling and
  acting with kindness that are phenomenal. Thus, it’s worthy to be
  motivated by <em>Flames and Fire</em>’s patterning.</p>
