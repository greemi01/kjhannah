<p>Writing books is like following the course of a river toward a waterfall; words necessarily
cascade. Sometimes, they fall over a great precipice. Always, they create a plungepool. No matter
the rate at which they are produced or the manner in which they drop over the edge, fashioning their
patterns is a pleasant pursuit.</p>
