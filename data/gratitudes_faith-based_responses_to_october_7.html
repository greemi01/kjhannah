<p>An existential war is going on between Israel and evil. To be of help, we must post about
loss, so that we know where our prayers, food, clothes, etc. ought to be sent. However, if
we’re to live with faith, simultaneously, we must retain joy. That is, we must make an effort
to bookmark our days with gratitude.
</p>

<p>Accordingly, a few days after Oct. 7, 2023, I began sending my local Nshei chapter nearly
daily gratitudes. I wanted to engage in acts of benevolence. I wanted to praise Hashem. Such
behaviors empower good to be victorious.
</p>

<p>Words, like balloons, can buoy us, or, has ’v’shalom, can send us crashing. When we
strengthen our faith in The Aibeshter, rather than in ourselves or in each other, we soar more
and fall less. Until the time when we disregard illusions and grasp verity, we’ll never be
airborne. Our elevation depends on our willingness to hold fast to meaningful things and to
release all tosh.
</p>

<p>By fashioning words of thankfulness, we can become fortified. By shaping our feelings into
units that are exchangeable with those of other folks, we can boost ourselves and others.
Thus, it’s vital for us to guard our ideas, to decry deceptions, and to contribute to shared
understandings of important concepts.
</p>

<p>If we’re writers or visual artists, the gifts that Hashem has bestowed upon us oblige us to
increase society’s awareness. In impacting the present, we change our understanding of the
past as well as alter our route to the future. We must appreciate Hashem’s chessed.
