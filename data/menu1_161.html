<p><em>Friends and Rabid Hedgehogs</em><br>
Bards &amp; Sages Publishing. USA.<br>
June 2016. Order <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Friends-Rabid-Hedgehogs-Hannah-Greenberg/dp/153355868X/ref=sr_1_11?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1499428416&amp;sr=1-11&amp;refinements=p_27%3AKJ+Hannah+Greenberg">here</a>.</p>

<p>Our problems are often no more than small, furry critters that are capable of casting grand
shadows. If we spin so that we face our challenges, instead of allowing ourselves to be thwarted by
them, we, not they, become the conquerors. Perspectives that empower such actions do not necessarily
transform our inner dwellers into cuties, but do take away much of their fiendishness.</p>

<p>Accordingly, although <em>Friends and Rabid Hedgehogs</em> looks like a mild-mannered collection
of brief fictions, it is at once also a savage series of realizations about human nature. This
book's roughly seventy flash and short stories are as much about means to confront our occupational
hazards and relationship foibles, as they are "simple tales" about dogs, cats, lobsters, and weird,
space-faring eukaryotic organisms.</p>

<p>All that has ever been murmured about the coterie of creatures contained herein is true and then
some; these furry and scaly players are often sweet only when sleeping. Thereafter, these monsters,
who are disguised as lanolin exporters, as incumbent politicians, or as alien spore, these strange
or familiar fiends, growl, yap, roar, or look askance at readers that mistake them for simple
beings. People, these characters posit, are the worst of beasties.</p>

<p>Fiction, more than co-play, therapy, or odd intimacies, continues to reveal humanity's brutish
tendencies. Accordingly, the creatures that populate <em>Friends and Rabid Hedgehogs </em>know that
the narratives that contain them are as much curative tools as entertainments. Goblins and guinea
pigs, even when dressed as dragons and dormice, help us identify our terrors and help us cope with
other folks' manifested creepy crawlies.</p>

<p>Whereas there remains much work to be done to compensate for the damage caused by imaginary
hedgehogs, there likewise remains much praise to be given to those rodents for their illuminating
frenetic behavior. Those bugs, like their fellow fauna, especially as found in <em>Friends and Rabid
Hedgehogs</em>, teach us important truths about ourselves.</p>
