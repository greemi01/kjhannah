Serialized in <em>Bewildering Stories</em>, 2022.</p>

<p>The protagonist of <em>The Ill-Advised Adventures of Jim-Jam O’Neily</em>, James Jackson Ariel O’Neily, is a loser who postures as a
champion.  Nonetheless, that proprietor of the Make-It-or-Break-It-That-Will-be-Fifty-Dollars-an-Hour-to-You-Mister backyard science
workshop gets plenty of dates and gains riches. After all, Jim-Jam is the kid who poisons the punch at the Autumn Harvest Dance, who imports
exotic, monstrous beasts, and who quests, with great sangfroid, among hobos, hackers, corporate executives, and passenger ship crews. His
ethics are knotty. He rationalizes. He strives to be a master flack.</p>

<p>To be more precise, Jim-Jam O’Neily causes: one of his nemeses to land in jail, another to be banished to a boarding school, and a third
to end up on a locked hospital ward. Additionally, his orchestration of events assures that an unsympathetic grownup gets assaulted by angry
barnyard fowl, and that two teenage bullies have to duke it out in a boxing class. Accordingly, he remains a regular target for his high
school’s most popular kids and for his school’s fiercest intimidators. Simply, folks hate him. Adults and adolescents, alike, frequently
make him the subject of their aggressions.</p>

<p>Simultaneously nasty and sweet, vainglorious and insecure, book brilliant and publicly stupid, and, most importantly, often inadvertently
funny, Jim-Jam O’Neily fashions: technology sought by the federal government, millinery products sought by desperate mothers, and biological
data sought by the enemies of a crooked, international ecology organization. Consequently, it’s easy to cheer his indirect expressions of
hostility – those deeds are the kinds of behaviors that we “good kids” wished we had actualized when we were intimidated by school-aged
ruffians and when we witnessed horrific crimes. It’s equally impressive to us that a gawky teenager can disrupt a self-important teacher’s
class and that he can transform his socially awkward peers into school leaders.</p>

<p>Sure, Jim-Jam tiptoes around his disapproving mother, and, sure, he finds himself battling another highly capable nerd; his life, like
our own, is far from perfect. Yet, dread never deters that boy from engaging in prodigious acts. That he escapes most scrapes
consequence-free, and that he is offered many college scholarships, surprises no one, albeit, we might wonder why he’s nice to some of his
antagonists.</p>

<p>All told, that adolescent virtuoso, James Jackson Ariel O’Neily, is as full of mishaps as his large, Indonesian lizards are full of
poison. He’s arbitrary in his friendships. He spews balderdash. He focuses on profit margins. He represents the rascal found in all of
us.</p>
