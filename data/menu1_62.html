<em>* You write some unusual, but fabulous fiction that reveals such an
imaginative and creative person behind the words. Was writing always
organic for you? Who or what inspires you?</em>
</p>
<p>
I’m somewhat eclectic. I’ve been: an oboe player, a chemistry and
calculus teacher, a weekend weight lifter, a National Endowment for
the Humanities Scholar (in the field of classics), a cooking
instructor, a member of the Society for Creative Anachronism, a public
relations intern, a community-based agriculture activist, a proponent
of the Sudbury School model of education, an adherent to a very
ancient religion, a flower arranger, a rhetoric professor, a companion
to multiple cats, an herbalist, a teacher of feminist sociology, a
cyclist, a swimmer, and a fan of berry-flavored yoghurt
drinks. Despite my eagerness to try out many things, I’ve never been
one to: throw pottery on a wheel, knead bread, enjoy teaching
trigonometry, learn about machines’ guts, be impressed by titles,
degrees, awards, or wealth, forget the power of laughter, or fail to
embrace my children’s Uromastyx lizard. Likewise, I refuse to inflate
students’ grades and I never fostered an affection for chocolate-chip
ice cream.
</p>
<p>
As a kid, I read Asimov, Heinlein, and Vonnegut. I also read Camus,
Hesse, and Sarte. In addition, I read about dog breeds, the history of
costumes, cutting edge surgical procedures, and ecology. In third
grade, most specifically, I fell in love with word play. By the time I
was fifteen, two newspapers paid me to contribute my views on a weekly
basis. As an eighteen-year-old college sophomore, I merited to have a
musical, for which I wrote the book and lyrics, staged. During
college, I moved from majoring in linguistics, to majoring in
biochemistry, to majoring in science writing. Shortly thereafter, I
ran away to the scholarly world, where I invested my energies in
academic forums. I was a regular contributor to national conferences
and spoke at international ones. What’s more, I taught Communication
Theory, Semantics, Social Values and Popular Culture, The Rhetoric of
Identity and close to three dozen other courses. As a professor, I
jumped among levels of meaning and mixed up all manner of examples and
of explanations. Sadly, that which enraptured me frightened my
students.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, years later, parenting returned me to the enormity and
value of human commonplaces. Since my children, who were neither
completely feral nor entirely broken of spirit, needed the boost that
fiction could lend them, I wrote narratives. My academic prose had
already morphed from treaties on Isocrates and on comparative
hierarchies of ethics to contemporary media’s presentation of
pregnancy loss. To leave behind footnotes and research libraries and
to strike, in its place, into provinces where heroes and villains
ranked supreme was a natural next step. So, my texts became concerned
with furry and scaly protagonists. Bedtime, lunchtime, any time,
really, became an occasion for my unbound sagas. My sons and daughters
demanded action, believability, and moral sensibility in their
entertainments. The ballads, which I wrote for them, featured little
sex, but contained much mauling and death; the fantasy genre tends to
be violent.
</p>
<p>
To wit, pink ponies, anthropomorphized mushrooms, berry bushes, jays,
mice, and leopards populated my early fabrications. Such works suited
my audience during those periods of their childhoods when they faced
anxieties about body image, bullies, and gatekeepers who lacked
compassion (elementary school teachers can be horrific in their
insistence on prescribed behaviors.) For my offspring, I intertwined
sentient slugs, reverberating piranhas, and sloths that glowed in
florescent light, with troll princesses, magical toddlers, and nobles
suffering from absentmindedness. At that juncture, when in the
classroom, I correspondingly granted permission to my students,
whether they were enrolled in grade school or in graduate school, to
seek out madcap combinations. My words looked comparable to play, and
tasted fun, but were fueled by much mindfulness.
</p>
<p>
<em>* You didn’t try to publish anything for a long time. What kept you
from submitting your work, and what made you finally decide to publish
it?</em>
</p>
<p>
I never stopped authoring. I temporarily got distracted from
rewriting, and, hence, had nothing that I deemed worthy to send to
publishers. During the decades that I devoted to raising my children,
I’d record a first draft of a novel, sketch out a limited quantity of
three act plays, make notes about characters I wanted to perform in
short fiction, or poke at a collection of poetry, but was so otherwise
occupied with transforming a suburban lawn into a series of wildflower
gardens, studying belly dancing, learning basket weaving, and trying,
but failing, to bake cakes, that for a span, I did not satisfactorily
finish those projects.  I did, however, generate another newspaper
column and teach writing, public speaking, sociology, and
human communications.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, I’ve long held that one ought never to submit
junk. The limited number of times when I elected to produce low fibre,
non-nutritious, brain food, I did so with intentionally and I labeled
such balderdash with ample warnings. As a result, for twenty years, I
wrote a lot, but tendered little.
</p>
<p>
Time passed. My family moved from North America to a land where
scholars lacking proficiency in the local tongue are in small
demand. I morphed again, returning to hewing assemblages of
words. Toward that end, I shared yarns at women’s gatherings, wrote a
blog for an international site, taught narrative craft to ex-patriots,
and began to accept new invitations to judge and to critique others’
output. Eventually, I marshalled snippets of my formerly incomplete handiworks
and sent those puppies to new homes. The subsequent, positive response
I received buoyed me, a midlife mom, to attempt to conjure new
pieces and to try to refine the items that were still in my reserve.
</p>
<p>
<em>* Your collection of work is extensive. It always seems that you have
something, or, more often, multiple new things to share. What is your
writing process like?</em>
</p>
<p>
My mother claims that as a toddler, I insisted on regularly being
lowered into my playpen to converse with make-believe friends. I
suppose it could be said that whereas I have gotten older, I have not
aged. To date, I remain this side of crazy and that side of
incorrigible. Much to my logical positivist husband’s chagrin, I
usually have anywhere from five to twenty windows concurrently opened
on my desktop. In the same way, I paint multiple canvases
simultaneously, develop three or four samples of hand-built ceramics
at a time, and use my family’s entire stovetop’s worth of burners when
cooking. Synergy fuels me. I might appear staid, even frumpy, but
those verities are mere externalities. More exactly, I delight in
moving ideas that “suit” poetry into essays and take pleasure in
welcoming personages “appropriate” for novels into short stories.
</p>
<p>
* You’ve written a lot about your children. Does parenthood affect
what you find yourself writing?
</p>
<p>
Used wisely, parenting is more than an opportunity to torture, I mean
to nurture, a new generation or to heal the rough spots of one’s own
earlier life. Parenting can equally free one from the encumberments of
society.
</p>
<p>
My kids were fond of linking clover crowns, painting pictures directly
onto our walls, and taking night-time slug walks. Yet, I was the
family member who went crazy over computer-assisted physics games,
who wanted all the visitors to our home to reinterpret eggplant as
dessert, and who had to be pulled back from stroking every cute
kitten, every domesticated alpaca, or every chinchilla coat that we
encountered. Whereas my sons and daughters grew up in an environment
that both intentionally and inadvertently encouraged them to engage in
critical and creative thinking, it was Yours Truly who was most
profoundly impacted by our family’s practice of
non-judgment. Consequently, today, there’s nothing surreptitious about
my fictions containing face-eating spiny mammals, purple and green
refrigerator colonists, or orphaned chimeras angered by humanity’s
overall lack of dry wit.
</p>
<p>

At the same time as those teens and twenties, who were born to our
manor, tried to figure out how to hide me when their friends visited,
I revelled in the succulence of raising them. Shamelessly, I hung
hand-dried flowers over the tops of our living room cabinets and
flapped my arms when sitting in the passenger seat of our car.
</p>
<p>
<em>* You have done just about everything: write, edit, teach, critique,
blog, and the list goes on. Is there anything that you like (either
guiltily or without apology) above the others?</em>
</p>
<p>
The best is in the here and now as it always was, and as it always
will be. It may seem trite to talk about the “present” as being our
lives’ great “gift,” but excellence is the current moment. Beyond such
gratitude, and with no hesitation, I daily shout, aloud, that being a
wife, a mom, and a grandmom are the most exquisite facets of my life.
Although the varmints I birthed had the audacity to grow up and to
seek their own escapades, they left behind irresistable playthings
such as an invisible Komodo dragon and such as their father. It’s of
small wonder that I continue to celebrate life by jotting down bits
and bobs about my family.
</p>
<p>
<em>
* Do you have any advice for aspiring writers or people who are trying
to get their work noticed?</em>
</p>
<p>

There are four ingredients to writing: read, read, read, write, write,
write, rewrite, rewrite, rewrite, rewrite, rewrite, rewrite, rewrite,
and risk soliciting feedback from people whose efforts you
esteem. Reading increases vocabulary, forms new synaptic connections,
i.e., expands mental capacity, and, in other respects, teaches the
innate qualities of discourse. Albeit akin to playing basketball or to
making soufflés, word work is improved with practice. Beyond those
ideas, it’s vital to solicit feedback so as to uncover blind spots.
Yet, rewriting remains the essence of writing. Revision is so
invaluable that even after a manuscript has been published, it remains
incomplete. Consider the chronicle of any freestanding narrative that
has gotten reprinted, or that has gotten repurposed as part of an
anthology; almost always, it’s been reworked.
