<p>Small fictions, like the eighty stories constituting <em>The
Immediacy of Emotional Kerfuffles,</em> make for great means to
explore our <em>pathos, </em>to unabashedly strip away old-fashioned
prejudices, and even to dally at the bizarre edges of
living<em>. </em>Ordinarily, we have to be goaded into examining such
“minutia” since we remain comfortable minimalizing, rationalizing, and
otherwise discounting the little features of our existence. While
there are important ramifications, for instance, of nursing a baby, of
quaffing Quaaludes, of battling lice, or of being a victim of a
drive-by shooting, most often we miss those significances because we
elect not to think about them.</p>

<p>By engaging in rough hewn fiction, we let literature beg the
question for us. Sure, such poking around might initially hurt, but,
ultimately, this type of deconstruction, the type supplied by
unpretentious narrative, can relieve much internal pressure. By using
brief tales to vivisect marriage, family units, friendship, and
passing fancies, we can: reify our ideas, celebrate the meaning we
assign to our mentations, and explicate some of the responses we have
to our notions’ actualizations.</p>

<p>It <em>is</em> instructive to explore rape, murder, and the cost of
not protecting children from fiduciary exploitation. Likewise, there’s
utility in grasping the essence of: our relative readiness to jump
into our dreams, fluid social strata, and the morphing of “what ifs”
into functional realities. In parlaying near-future dialogues between
seer and mental health professionals, in getting the gist of select
bachelors’ solutions to pressing parenting dilemmas, and in deeply
understanding the sort of greed that is too often shared among
executives and their unskilled workers, we gift ourselves with
knowledge useful to our daily lives.</p>

<p><em>The Immediacy of Emotional
Kerfuffles<em><strong> </strong></em></em><em>bites, nibbles, and
even, sometimes, mauls aspects of our condition from which we might,
left to our </em><em>own cognizance, shy. In piercing topical taboos,
in evoking </em>groans, moans, exhalations and tears, this collection
returns us to the truth of our humanity.</p>
