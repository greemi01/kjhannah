<p>Even as I become silver-haired, I remain enamored of rolling around with congregations of words. BH, I’ve long enjoyed writing.</p>

<p>As a toddler, allegedly, I fashioned stories for imaginary playpen friends. As a youngster, I
maneuvered characters and settings as readily as I mixed acrylic hues or combined turmeric and
capsaicin. As a college student, and then as a graduate student, I fashioned scholarly papers and
newspaper columns. Thereafter, as a professor, I taught courses about language and people, including
Semantics, Communication Ethics, Expository Writing, Interpersonal Communication, Social Values and
Popular Culture, The History of Western Thought, Rhetorical Theory, and Feminist Prose.</p>

<p>These days, as an author, I compose nonfiction books about Israel, about parenting, and about the
publishing industry. I assemble fiction collections featuring two-headed wildebeests and mischievous
adolescent geniuses. I craft poetry assemblages that reach from the stars to cesspools, i.e., that
portray glittery as well as fetid actualities. Across genres, I do all that I can to embrace the
never-ending charm that’s concommitant to manipulating lexes.</p>

<p>Along the way, I‘ve had more than four dozen books published. Among these corpora is
poetry. <em>Miscellaneous Parlor Tricks</em> gleans the best from my first sixteen books of poetry.</p>

<p>So, pull up a mug and adjust your pillow. Take pleasure with me in this mustering of
verse. <em>Miscellaneous Parlor Tricks</em> will provide a window as to why it’s fun to play in verse.</p>
