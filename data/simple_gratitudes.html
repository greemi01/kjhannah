<p>It’s neither riches nor social status that makes our tenacious hanging on to life worthwhile. Rather, it’s our integration of challenging “sensibilities,” of deep feelings which might be sweet, but which are necessarily sharply disconcerting, that stretches us and that enables us to grasp the best qualities of this world. “Gratitude,” not “entitlement,” remains the proven route, within our mortal existence, to serving The Almighty and to   finding joy in our service.</p>
<p>What’s more, it both behooves us to see the entirety of our commonplace experiences as spiritual, and to elevate all off our spiritual happenstances. When we embrace our inspiration from G-d, our inspiration from others, our inspiration from ourselves, our inspiration from life’s joys, and our inspiration from life’s difficulties, we become fulfilled. Everything we encounter, no matter how seemingly taxing, is for our benefit. Our reaching great heights necessitate our grasping that our days and nights must be based on these sources of motivation to action.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Simply Gratitudes exists to broadcast the value of these sources as is articulated in the book’s seventy instances of thanks. This assemblage means to raise our souls and to emphasize the importance of actualizing deeds of loving kindness. After all, no matter the nature of our lived deliberations, we are responsibile not only to continuously push to do our best, but also to welcome all of the events that shape our personal evolutions.</p>
<p>So much work has yet to be completed in our process of releasing personal and social expectations and in replacing those anticipatory notions with simple faith. Simple Gratitudes invites us to live by working for The Boss.</p>
