<p>This novel is about two fifth graders, one of whom is trying to
  acclimate to a new culture and one of whom is trying to learn not to
  judge people who might be different from her, her friends, and her
  family. <em>My Neighbor Judy</em> emphasizes the importance of
  tolerance, understanding, and unity, i.e. v’ahavta l’reacha
  kamocha.</p>

<p>Although this story takes place in an imaginary town, Meadow Wood,
  New Jersey, its driving conflict, the difficulty that people have
  accepting actions, words, and thoughts dissimilar to their own, is
  universal. Whereas “acceptance” is not “approval," being able to
  acknowledge the existence and significance of others’ worldviews
  remains an invaluable interpersonal skill.</p>
