</p>

<p>My head is full of words; I spend a lot of time rolling around in my
thoughts. All the same, whereas electronic and print venues willingly
host my books and shorter works, none of my poems, stories, essays,
novels, live lectures, or telecasts ever excused (and ought not to
have excused) me from making soup for Sabbath, engaging in weekday
laundry, or being responsible for the concepts I express.</p>

<p>See, my imaginative sharing’s not limited to tales of fantastic
critters or shimmery skies. Sometimes, (gasp!) I write about cultural
veracities, which, though important, are ordinarily less
“entertaining” than narratives about gelatinous wildebeests. Still and
all, by portioning out relatively staider gleanings, whether those
assemblages shed light on careers, religion, family, or femininity, I
endeavor to be helpful—communications remain more powerful than
apparatuses and more precious than serums in impacting lives.</p>

<p>Writers owe readers accountability apart from the extent to which
readers get invested in published materials, specifically, or in
community principles, more generally. Authors’ yields, wittingly or
not, sanction other people’s promotions of collective efforts and
unblock their attempts to resolve private kerfuffles. By extending
protective or even “decorative” perimeters, originators gift publics
with all manner of attributions that can be affixed to experienced
events.</p>

<p>So, wordsmiths’ obligation to address amazing as well as pedestrian
deeds is endless. What’s more, wordies to a certain extent, are
answerable when society’s wardens employ their scribblings to back
actions that auteurs might never embrace.</p>

<p>Accordingly, in this volume, I caution word players about our communal
duties. As a confrère skilled in expanding upon goings-on plus as a
gal skilled in stating fine points, I’m taking charge of the
rhetorical results of my productivity and asking readers to do the
same. It’s my hope that this book, plus the other parts of <em>Granny Does
It</em>, improve lives by dispeling social myths and by laying out
alternatives to some of the unease experienced in the status quo.</p>

<p>Fasten your seatbelt; we’re going to journey through many truth
paradigms. The scenery might be remarkable but the ride will be
turbulent.</p>
