<p><em>Conversations on Communication Ethics</em> is an assemblage of essays on morality and
communication, which covers topics ranging from the history of communication ethics to contemporary
issues of morality. Insights into persuasion and morality and into political communication, too, are
included. As J. Vernon Jensen alludes in the foreword, this bookÂ  grapples "with the tension between
relativistic and absolute ethics, between ends and means, between the 'is' and the 'ought' and
between private and publc goods."</p>  Acknowledgments<br>
