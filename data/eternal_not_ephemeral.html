<p>Since ostensibly forever, yampy grands have been mindful that fashioning fiction endures as a
means of providing future generations with knowledge, no matter those young’s storytelling
habits. Consider that when new steamship captains, fresh fried rice entrepreneurs, or untested
students of veterinary medicine will seek insights within contemporary society’s lexis, given our
culture’s complications, weak men will cry, strong women will jump from undersized buildings, and
imaginary hedgehogs will shelter with unicorns. </p>

<p>Granted, many daughters write beautiful prose, many sons are prolific raconteurs, and large
numbers of grandchildren have keen imaginations. Nonetheless, it continues to be up to grannies and
grandpas to use words to complete the difficult parts of consciousness-raising because stuck
positions, stifling strictures, and infighting are laughable to persons who care nothing for
external validation. </p>

<p>It’s not so much that youngsters quell the number and kinds of questions that they proffer, as
much as it is that until people age, they are uncomfortable holding, let alone articulating
“ghastly” sentiments. More exactly, hoary individuals, unlike fresh faces, are prepared to cleave to
robust beliefs and to distribute them as congregations of words. Ancients, not adolescents, overall,
are responsible for intrepidly crafting chronicles that focus on society’s “overwhelming”
issues. </p>

<p>Even in cases in which barflies, Komodo dragons, or British dragoons feel constrained by dogma,
silver-haired folks continue to utilize tall tales and short ones to laser through goings-on; OAPs
have lived too long to allow any miasma of misunderstanding to shroud their
rhetoric. Notwithstanding specific misdirection issued by toxic wildebeests, magniloquent
politicians, and other gabbling revolutionaries, elders’ narratives, built from small portions of
phlogiston and larger measures of heart, uniquely promote critical and creative thinking.</p>
