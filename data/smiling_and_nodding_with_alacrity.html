<p>Recently, Missy Younger became a lawyer, thus fulfilling my mother’s dream. Mom wanted to become
a lawyer, but, as it was the early 1960s, she left college to parent me. I was born in 1960. My only
sibling, a sister, was born in 1963.</p>

<p>When Sis and I were preteens, Mom opened a small dress shop. However, Mom spent most of her adult
life looking after my very ill father. Due to her good care, despite Dad’s multiple sclerosis, and
despite the fact that for his last fifteen years, he had twenty-four hour nursing, Dad lived to be
sixty-five.</p>

<p>When I came of age, Mom encouraged me to become a lawyer. Whereas I was interested in words and
people and in the connection between them, I was not interested in applied discourse
analysis. Rather than becoming a lawyer, I became a rhetoric professor. I taught theories of
persuasion to would-be politicians, investors, and lawyers. Yet, I became troubled by the power of
words and held myself responsible for teaching accountability alongside of suasory skills. To wit, I
focused my scholarship on the ethics of communication.</p>

<p>One area of my research was the history of communication ethics. I was privileged to work on a
yet incomplete book on that topic, at Princeton University, as a National Endowment for the
Humanities Summer Scholar. Additionally, I researched the actual vs. the purported discourse among
hospital representatives, doctors, and patients. I even interviewed for positions on hospital ethics
committees. As well, I applied my resources to exploring the relative morality of university
educators’ classroom speech. I remained “allergic” to abused power.</p>

<p>In the 1980s and 1990s, my scholarship was considered “sexy.” To wit, I was blessed to land my
first academic book contract upon finishing graduate school and was blessed to receive national and
regional honors. I spoke about my findings at a European communication conference, too.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I left behind academia’s rigmarole to raise my children. I'm glad I stayed
home. While my family’s household budget, consequently, was tight, my sons and daughters had more
than twenty years’ worth of a full-time mother. When those offspring were older, Hashem granted my
family the miracle of aliyah.</p>

<p>Initially, in Israel, I taught expository writing courses at universities. I also taught creative
writing via private workshops. Eventually, fortunately, I transitioned into full-time writing. BH,
b'ayin tova, to date, more than thirty of my novels, poetry collections, fiction collections, essay
collections, and more, have been published.</p>

<p>I will never become a lawyer. I’m glad for my mother that my younger daughter, contrariwise, is
now one. I doubt I’ll ever return to the university classroom or pursue additional academic
research, as well. For today, I’m grateful to be a ma and a grandma. Because I am a daughter of
  Hashem, I know the future will be wonderful.</p>
