<p>We whisper to ourselves that there is no Abominable Snowman. We
  whimper that we could catch a cold if we’re exposed to viruses, but
  not if we walk outside with wet hair on winter days. We posit that
  the richness of our personalities is far more important than our
  fiduciary standing. Nonetheless, most of us moan when we: suspect
  moving shadows are watching us fall asleep, sneeze during holiday
  festivities, or want material goods whose costs outstrip our
  resources. Fortunately, we’re sometimes called out on this
  lunacy.</p>

<p><em>Ten Kilo and One Million</em> is one such challenge to our
  innate craziness. Although a fanciful tale, this book is also a
  thoughtful one. In this story of self-discovery, a ceramic artist,
  who used to be a chemist, strives to become a psychologist. Also: a
  glass-eyed oncologist tries to make empirical sense out of the
  qualitative experience that is furrydom, a python nonchalantly sucks
  down an all-but-retired horse whisperer, a simple barkeep earns a
  large fortune selling peanut butter and jelly-covered sushi, a
  thespian, who formerly practiced free love, settles into marriage, a
  coterie of Junior Leaguers learns to temporarily suspend its efforts
  at image management, and a rhetoric professor reevaluates the worth
  of her struggle to maintain career-engined social status.</p>

<p>To confront its readers, <em>Ten Kilo and One Million</em> uses
  hyperbole. Similarly, this story places ferry captains, anatomically
  correct marzipan, a dead Trait du Nord, and a cat habituated to
  farting, in juxtaposition to questions about: the role of reverence
  in dysfunctional families, the significance of biological clocks,
  the importance of preserving local ecosystems, the worth of
  professional accomplishments, and the emotional, psychological and
  symbolic value of profound riches.</p>

<p>This book’s inclusion of sex, drugs, and rock &amp; roll is not
  what endears it; plenty of existent narratives feature musicians
  paying bills by selling pot to authorities or set designers
  repeatedly losing hold of their bloomers.  Rather, <em>Ten Kilo and
    One Million</em> is special because it invites its readers to
  think critically about life.</p>

<p><em>Ten Kilo and One Million</em> asserts that long-term
  complications can often be resolved through simple tactics. Going to
  college and graduate school, and then, finally, arriving at a
  tenured position, for instance, is shown as less desirable than
  establishing lasting friendships. Heading up a multimillion dollar
  conglomerate, for example, is portrayed as bringing less happiness
  than marrying and parenting. Eating countless mice is shown to be
  sating, but is, as well, shown to be the cause of tummy aches.</p>

<p>Correspondingly, <em>Ten Kilo and One Million</em> can and ought to
  be read for laughs, yet it also can and ought to be read to call to
  mind the merit of being accountable. There’s no singular best way to
  react to life’s tests of our patience and endurance; we “win” only
  when we’re culpable for our responses. To wit, it’s in our interest
  to allow this book’s disturbed academic, her gallery of quirky
  friends, and the strip poker games, oregano brownies, designer duds,
  and pesticide companies, with which they interact, to ease us into
  self-exploration.</p>
