<p><em>Dancing with Hedgehogs</em><br> Fowlpox Press. Canada.<br> December 2014. Scroll <a href="http://issuu.com/fowlpoxpress/docs/dancing_with_hedgehogs_kj_hannah_gr">here</a>.</p>
<p>When hedgehogs get caught stealing Cheetos, it’s easier to sneak boys in than to slip girls out. To wit, all manners of poetry, rhymed and free ranging, traditional and so contemporary that the assemblages rival green peaches, twinkle stinking little stars in this chapbook.</p>
<p><em>Dancing with Hedgehogs</em> brings proof that the too often wished for squealing, self-anointing, and keratin-stiff aspects of existence, thought to be indigenous to both spiny mammals and verse, get left behind when puppies’ playful stance, joggers’ chant, or other oddly pitched “conversations,” muck with the gears and levers of cosmic meaning. In brief, this text espouses that unwarranted cultural snobbery serves neither man nor beast.</p>
<p>Accordingly, <em>Dancing with Hedgehogs</em> strives to focus our mentations on hip hop among the branches, means for deconstructing literature’s intercultural mythos, and ever ubiquitous starlight. If this collection’s readers snort, guffaw, or cry a bit en route, it’s okay; sometimes we win, sometimes we fail. Nonetheless, always, it suits us to tuck into a stanza or ten and to embrace an assortment of favorable and challenging goings on.</p>
