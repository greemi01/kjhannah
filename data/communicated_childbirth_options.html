<p><em>Communicated Childbirth Options</em> seeks to aid our comprehension of our encounters. This
collection of poems operates without the constraints of particular sentiments; everything never was
nor ever will be equal despite our civilization’s insistence on guidelines for thinking, speaking,
and acting. Accordingly, age-old prescriptive, and descriptive linguistic theories, which are
exemplified by the content of many sacred and secular texts, fail to thrill modern folks. That is,
when we skip free of others’ opinions, we create better poetry.</p>

<p>Plus, since metalinguistic conceptualizations are not broadly legitimized, but serve mostly as
escapes from relativism, it’s best for us to disregard them when crafting verse. In plain terms, as
humankind is still testing its norms, values, and virtues, we clinch increasingly fewer instances of
polysemic patois, e.g., increasingly less poetry. Consequently, our culture largely ignores the
utilitarian similitude between pragmatics and semantics. That dearth’s a pity.</p>

<p>Inversely, we’re well-advised to look upon standards of conduct and upon words as
distinct. Although most literary venues approve of cheerful, else, melancholy communications, and
although few laud writing that contains both dispositions, it’s vital that we embrace assemblages
that are concurrently sunny and somber. More exactly, we need to reject divisions between archetypes
because we need a wealth of standards to scaffold our hierarchies of
significance. Hence, <em>Communicated Childbirth Options</em> offers up peevish bits and bobs as
well as gives over celebrations.</p>
 
<p>Moreso, <em>Communicated Childbirth Options</em> does not aim to reveal new facts about
traditional approaches to ethnography or to provide fresh insights on theories of language. Rather,
the poems contained herein seek to apply existent information about worldviews to the study of
mortal activity, viz., to help us cope with our sundry “growth experiences.” The matters
that <em>Communicated Childbirth Options</em> deliberates are not meant as philosophical/iconistic
remedies but as starting points for future inquiry.</p>
