<em>Rhetorical Candy</em><br> With Rivka Gross.<br>Seashell Books. USA.<br>Mar. 2018. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984057286/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1522006884&amp;sr=1-2&amp;refinements=p_27%3AKJ+Hannah+Greenberg">Order here.<br></a><br>Most goings on can be interpreted in at least two ways, only one of which usually gets proffered. It makes no difference what the topic is or which perspective gets favored; folk generally stick to a single position. Consider the subject of The Modern State of Israel. Few among the globe's population are Israelis. Nonetheless, the majority of the world's denizens vociferously disagree amongst themselves on: the morality of Israel, the sanctity of Israel, the social milieu of Israel, and appropriate responses to the existence of Israel.
<p>Leaders and followers, alike, would be well served to learn more about the Holy Land, especially more about: nationalism versus universalism, the character and function of democracy, and the essence of diplomacy. To boot, politicos educated in the traditions of the west, specifically, and other world citizens, more generally, would gain from increasing their understanding of: freedom of speech, economics, the philosophy of science, Zionism, and Judaism.</p>
<p>The State of Israel is an amazing place, well-deserving of informed discourse. This country's fruit crowns world agricultural, the Holy Land's high tech is second to none, and her military know-how, too, is superlative. Most importantly, Israel is this globe's spiritual capitol. There's a lot for mankind to learn about and from Israel.<br> <br>Toward that end, the sixty-two narratives that constitute<em> Rhetorical Candy</em> reflect on images of, suppositions about, and lived experiences indigenous to Israel, including: Asian laborers, rebbes toting BUL M5-pistols, and five year-olds chaperoning three year-old siblings, via public transportation, to school. This book's graphic writing style additionally captures: sunsets over Jerusalem, traditions woven into local celebrations of life events, and the awesomeness of the Israeli medical system.</p>
<p>The Jewish state is neither an ongoing beach party nor a perpetual war zone. Rather, Israel is a place of great supernal energy as well as home to egrets, hyraxes, and other extraordinary samples of Creation. All of us lose when Israel is misunderstood. We need books like <em>Rhetorical Candy</em> to correct erroneous portrayals of this nation. We need to taste truth about Israel, if only one essay at a time.</p>
