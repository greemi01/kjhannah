<h3>Do Not Compete with Evil Doers.</h3>


<p>Retirement age is often about empty nesting and grandchildren. In some cases, it is equally about
war, facing down international prejudices, and coping with increased disability. Likewise, getting
older might bring along late applications of professional skills, newfound gratitude for being alive
and for the small and large miracles that constitute daily existence, and a measure of nostalgia for
personal and social history. <em>Do Not Compete with Evil Doers</em> explores all of these
topics.</p>
