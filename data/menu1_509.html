<p>Professional accomplishment is nice, desirable, and economically helpful, but not
quintessential. More specifically, musing about the exactitudes of literature, is, at best, of
limited relevance to life. Writers ought, instead, to place their relationships before their
accomplishments.</p>

<p>On balance, the exploration of fiery topics exposes important ideas and can discomfort readers
sufficiently for them to take notice or, ideally, to evoke social change. Writing that urges
principles to become actions is worth the time required for its construction. That is, whether
storytellers concern themselves with the minutia of garum made from fish entrails or with the gist
of seemingly impossible future cities’ arcology, they must remain inquisitive and express curiosity
about all manner of trifles and all manner of nitty-gritty. Both details and aggregates, often for
entirely different reasons, ought to be illuminated by authors.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, romanticizing manuscripts is dysfunctional. Editors and publishers are aware of what
sells. Work gets published not because of high flying moral standards but because of factors
existing “beyond the page.” When considering which books to produce, gatekeepers usually look first
at potential revenues. Hence, neither a work’s literary quality nor its originator’s relative
charisma are primary considerations in a volume’s acceptance.</p>

<p>Still, wordies tend to live far away from the fiduciary world. Accordingly, they care that
whereas not all of their tales are preternatural, all of them should harbor consequence.</p>

<p>To wit, this collection of stories includes genre literature as well as mainstream fare. In this
assemblage, for instance, a feral cat is depicted in a tale about a tiger, in a story about a feline
from another world, and in an allegory about a lost kitten. Kowtowing to market requirements is
formulaic to writing, but so, too is crafting entertaining or enlightening pieces.</p>
