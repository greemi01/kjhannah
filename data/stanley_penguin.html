<p>The picture book, <em>Stanley Penguin</em>, is the story of a young boy, Michael, who makes an
unlikely friend at a local zoo. Michael's repeated use of his fine character traits teaches readers
that it's not a person’s tools that matter, but how they're used.</p>

<p>In brief, Michael and Mom visit a zoo, where Michael sees Stanley in trouble and rescues
him. Thereafter, Stanley accompanies Michael and Mom on zoo “adventures.” When Michael and Mom
leave, Stanley follows them home.</p>

<p>However, Michael and Mom realize that Stanley belongs in his own home, not in theirs. They return
him to the zoo and promise to visit.</p>
