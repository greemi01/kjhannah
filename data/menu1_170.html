<p>Most problems, upon analysis, prove to consist merely of small,
  furry critters, of creatures that cast grand shadows. Consequently,
  if we spin to face our difficulties, rather than run from them, we
  can understand their parameters and, thus, can conquer them.</p>

<p>Simply, we need to face the brutes in our lives. We need to
  chronicle them in books like <em>Concatenation. </em>Facing our
  monsters enables us to ferry them across familiar domains to
  philosophical umlands, to locales where they can be forced to
  incorporate new ideas, and where we can be forced to taste
  bamboo-flavored snow. It doesn’t hurt us to witness pretend wombats
  or make-believe crystalline chanticleers. Rather, observing them
  stimulates our compassion.</p>

<p>Said differently, since we remain a society of haters, who are
  neither impartial nor generous, we win when we allow creative pages
  to help us unload offensive presuppositions and atrophying
  prejudices. After all, it’s our “companion creatures,” plus their
  fiendish cohorts, that: shamelessly bite our dwelt upon principles,
  fearlessly suck down our blinkered prescriptions, and audaciously
  trash most of the others of our multifarious self-made terrors.</p>

<p>It’s us, not our ogres, imaginary or otherwise, which can’t
  differentiate among real, virtual, and conspicuously false mores. As
  long as we continue to have nothing to do with screw-jiggy
  accountability, we leave ourselves open to villains’ shrewdness, the
  machinations of marshmallow factory bosses, the dishonesty of
  interspecies households, and the wickedness of galactic
  groupies.</p>

<p>Granted, morally empowering perspectives don’t necessarily
  transform our rottenness into loveliness, but auxiliary viewpoints
  do generate sufficient brass to get us beyond any astonishment we
  feel about human malice. That is, new outlooks on old twaddle allow
  us to declaw and to defang ours dark traits and to palliate their
  corresponding, corrupt characteristics. More exactingly, literary
  dissonance helps us to identify and to defeat our psychic
  terrors.</p>

<p>Alternatives to such investigations, namely, modes of steering away
  from responsibility for our inner goings-on, are poor dodges. We
  need stories about anthropomorphic <em>amigurumi and about
    ambivalent, tentacled salesmen if we are to beat back our nastiest
    attributes. </em>Few nonfiction expositions about our mentations,
  our words, or our deeds stick it to our guts as well as do invented
  accounts of masquerading lanolin exporters, hard science fiction
  about alien soldiers standing <em>in enfilade, or cross-genred
    stories concerning Lilliputian families picnicking in the
    Horseshoe Galaxy.</em></p>

<p>Whereas no single collection of fiction can solve all of our
  problems, <em>Concatenation</em>’s tales will help us process some
  of them. So, while we eat our oatmeal or chew our cud, we ought, as
  well, to embrace the antics of profligate, spacefaring, illusory
  hedgehogs and their many and varied cohorts. Paying attention to
  vicious animals’ skippering will help us improve ourselves. In
  riding alongside them, our lives will be enlightened.</p>
