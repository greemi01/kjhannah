</p>

<p>One of the greatest obligations we Jews have is to dwell in our
  homeland, Eretz Yisrael. Fulfilling this duty bring privilege. Yet,
  it's costly to answer this calling.</p>

<p>On the one hand, there's a lot of Torah learning going on in
  Israel. Plus, we can perform more of the 613 mitzvot, here, than we
  can anywhere else. As well, we can live more joyously, here, than we
  can anywhere else, and we can holder tighter to our moral compass,
  here, than we can anywhere else. Additionally, it's only to the Holy
  Land that we will be ingathered and it's only from here that
  children need no incentive to make aliyah. What's more, Israelis
  don't have to choose between blending in with non-Jews, and being
  socially ostracized. Additionally, Israelis are not embarrassed
  about their spiritual heritage.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Israelis have fewer material choices than do
  North Americans, Australians, and Europeans. Further, Israeli young
  ones are regularly exposed to poverty, to murder, and to ethnic
  hatred. Extended family might misunderstand individuals'
  aliyah. Besides, the other nations are set against us strengthening
  ourselves by coming home. It takes effort to live in the most
  consecrated of places.</p>

<p>My family's return to our homeland was no exception. Whereas,
  b'ayin tova, we escaped muggings and quickly learned not to buy
  exorbitantly, i.e. "special American priced" trinkets, nonetheless,
  our move from New Jersey to Jerusalem was fraught with health,
  interpersonal, spiritual, economic, and other challenges. Sure, the
  reward is according to the difficulty. Sure, my family members'
  respective four amot are the sweetest possible spaces on this
  earth. After all, settling in Israel enables us to: demonstrate our
  obedience to Hashem, fulfill our destinies, repay some of our debt
  to Hashem, repay some of our debt to our forefathers, pay forward
  some of our children's needs, and compensate ourselves.</p>

<p>Consider the following allegory. A guest once pointed to the
  crystal and to the handmade ceramic serving pieces sitting next to
  the recycled plastic containers on our Shabbat table. She asked how
  we determined which foodstuffs were to be presented in casual
  vessels and which in formal ones.</p>

<p>I smiled when answering and explained that whereas my family likes
  pretty things and makes them, including ceramic and glass vessels,
  my family also prefers to spend more time with people than
  chores. Consequently, if a comestible comes in a serviceable
  container, that container is placed, accordingly, on the table. If a
  comestible does not come in a serviceable container, my family
  utilizes our collection of beautiful objects.</p>

<p>Living in Israel is about elevating life. It's not about embracing
  beauty for self-aggrandization. Here, we embrace beauty to raise our
  spiritual state.</p>

<p>My family left behind matching place settings to live among
  gleaming sandstone buildings. We left behind American-styled
  affluence to live in a more transcendent manner. Sometimes, our
  heavenly life is stress-free. Other times, we whistle on route to
  salvation.</p>
