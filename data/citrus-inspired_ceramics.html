<p>"Hannah Greenberg crafts her poems like a master chef makes a
  confection. She starts with a perfectly baked crust of theme, be it
  whimsical or profound; pours in a rich filling of image and story;
  covers all with a titillating topping, a lush and lascivious
  whipping of words (read these aloud for sheer joy of the sound). Any
  one of these poems is the perfect dessert to complete a poetry
  feast. Read with a double espresso, though; you'll want your eyes
  wide open, so as not to miss a single, delicious crumb."<br>

"KJ Hannah Greenberg is the voice in the desert, the one who calls the
faithful, who tells the truth, who sees the future. Sometimes, it's
the sweet juice of melon on the tongue, other times it's the fall of
missiles on the city square. Bring a shawl to listen, you are going to
want to stay a while in these pages." Russell Streur, Editor
of <em>The Camel Saloon.</em>

<p><em>Citrus-Inspired Ceramics</em>’ seventy-eight verbal snapshots
  of Israel are friendly word pictures, which cover Middle Eastern
  life from Jerusalem’s caper blossom-filled limestone crevices to
  Route 6’s fueling stations’ recyclable, plastic benches. Within
  these sunny, sandy, cosmic pages, both butterflies and bullets
  fly.</p>

<p>A mélange of the Old World and of the New
  World, <em>Citrus-Inspired Ceramics</em> explores, all at once,
  weddings, friendships, intergovernmental strife, and the
  Holocaust. Here, egrets, beggars, ministers, ulpan teachers, and
  small children are simultaneously accessible. This collection
  provides entrée to intercultural celebrations, to global posturing,
  and to drip irrigation, as well as to strong coffee. What’s more,
  the verities of The Garden of Eden, of the ancient fathers and
  mothers, of the evil influence, and of The Almighty, Himself, are
  evoked, in chorus, in this book’s pages.</p>

<p>In grappling with the complexity of the Holy Land’s mall lines,
  religiously diverse neighborhoods, and military
  zones, <em>Citrus-Inspired Ceramics</em> improves our ability: to
  determine our personal and political values, rather than to allow
  the mass media to define them, to transport ourselves to this
  singular location, east of the Mediterranean, and south of heaven,
  to embrace Israel’s unique position in time and in space, and to
  cozy to the historical excitement for our Earthly sanctuary. While
  it is better to live in Israel than to visit, and better to visit
  than never to set food on these green acres, it remains more
  praiseworthy to wrestle with the complexity of this profound milieu
  than to do nothing to understand Israel at all.</p>
