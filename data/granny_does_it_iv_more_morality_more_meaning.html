<h3>More Morality, More Meaning</h3>

<p>In the previous volume of <em>Granny Does It, A Morality of Meaning</em>, I suggested that when evaluating
whether communication is compiled, i.e., gathered; created, i.e., made anew; or arrived at in some
other way, we must, simultaneously, evaluate the legitimacy ascribed to its undergirding
epistemology, think about how we assess both communication’s origins and human ingenuity.</p>

<p>Significant, contemporary, epistemic perspectives include cognitive objectivism, viewing being as
independent of creature characteristics including reasoning; experientialism, viewing human
continuation as “made possible by the body [including] abstract and creative reason, as well as
reasoning about concrete things” (Lakoff, xv); and relativism, videlicet, viewing the real world as
according to the mind’s parameters, not nature’s. Given this array, it’s unsurprising that divergent
outlooks exist on invention.</p>

<p>All the same, whether we use a compilation-based, an innovation-based, or some other scale for
weighing discovery, the act of weighing, itself, implies a weight. In recalling a weight’s relative
quality, we can better grasp the negative ramifications of legitimizing only a singular starting
point for creativity.</p>

<p>Hence, this volume of <em>Granny Does It</em> addresses multiple frames for communication and morality’s
sway on human behavior. Unlike works structured for sophisticated audiences and well-grounded in
contemporary communication theory, <em>More Morality, More Meaning</em> is patterned for readers with little
or no training in these topics. The same, unlike works aiming to provide answers, <em>More Morality,
More Meaning</em> purports to raise questions. This book outlines communication ethics as reliant on
history, individuals, <em>and</em> institutions.</p>

<p>Like James Jaksa and Michael Pritchard’s Communication Ethics: Methods of Analysis, More
Morality, More Meaning uses a holistic approach to illustrating the relationship between semantics
and philosophy. Although both books discuss a variety of systems for elucidating
rhetorical/philosophical interdependence, unlike Jaksa and Pritchard’s work, More Morality, More
Meaning draws from Torah in addition to secular sources.</p>

<p>Moreover, like Richard L. Johannesen’s Ethics in Human Communication), <em>More Morality, More
Meaning</em> emphasizes the historical significance of the ethical dimension of communication. Both
manuscripts explore morality and meaning in a variety of communication contexts and use multiple
examples and explanations to flesh out those concepts. However, <em>More Morality, More Meaning</em> presents
communication ethics as both product and process. This book describes, not prescribes, communication
norms, values, and virtues. Additionally, <em>More Morality, More Meaning’s</em> standpoint is more
parsimonious than those of related books. Plus, <em>More Morality, More Meaning’s</em> premises enquiries
about, not professes about, human interactions.</p>

<p>It’s sensible to fabricate multifarious references, across networks, that illuminate how and why
we employ words to devise our veracities. For that reason, this final volume of <em>Granny Does It: More
Morality, More Meaning</em>, hopes to provide judicious insights into the linkages among our principles
expressions, and experiences.</p>

<div class='center'>****</div>
<p>In the midst of this book’s preparation, Operation Swords of Iron began. More than one thousand
Israelis were massacred on Oct. 7, 2023. It was impossible for me not to respond to that
atrocity. Although, originally, this book was meant to comment on “general” communication, given
Israel’s existential crisis, the book’s content shifted. <em>More Morality, More Meaning</em> is, hopefully,
now a perspicuous expansion of my thoughts. More exactly, while my words remain landed on everyday
themes, large numbers of them have become contextualized in wartime maneuvers. That is, my ideas
still address universal topics, but my examples have become specific.</p>

<p>Akin to how, when I was a young academic, I was interested in studying and teaching abstract
topics, e.g., Rhetorical Theory and The Rhetoric of Identity, etc., but when I aged, I grasped my
obligation to teach more grounded courses, e.g., The Rhetoric of Women’s Cycles: Discourse
Concerning Menses, Maternity, and Menopause, and Media Ethics, when I started <em>More Morality,
More Meaning</em>, I compiled ideas about communication’s mundanities, only, given the war’s advent,
to comprehend my responsibility to write about determinate subjects, e.g., antisemitism and
spiritual propriety. So, whereas <em>More Morality, More Meaning</em> remains a book about
communication accountability, it’s grown into a book about horrific, international, wartime rhetoric
and about the importance of cleaving to Hashem.</p>
