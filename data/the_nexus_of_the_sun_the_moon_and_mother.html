<p>It is not so much that I don’t feed my offspring properly, dress
  them appropriately, or otherwise keep them off of the streets. I
  even entertain them with my efforts to not look frumpy and to speak
  in local discourse.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, they protest, saying that grown women ought to wear
  colors other than black or navy and that it would suit them if I
  didn’t talk garbled Hebrew in front of their friends, specifically,
  or in front of anyone they might know them, in general. They insist,
  as well, that my behavior evidences my failure to grasp the
  rudiments of parenting. Those kids gripe, too, that they needed a
  raise in allowance, about twenty months ago.</p>

<p>In response, I smile and nod. They can blather all they want; I’ve
  earned every bit of my maternal status. Whereas I used to greet the
  sun regularly when they were small, these days, I meet that
  celestial body as the end of my work hours. What’s more, I am
  charmed, not alarmed, by my sons and daughters’ adolescent
  goings-on.</p>

<p>So what if a sister’s friend’s dog has eaten someone’s homework? So
  what if a brother’s undies turned pink because someone else mixed up
  the laundry? So what if the boys and the girls tower over their
  father and me? So what if they bake a kind of chocolate chip cookie
  that leaves my version at the starting gate?</p>

<p>In exchange for merely observing their sibling feuds, their
  “creatively” decorated rooms, and their unusual approaches to
  emptying the dishwasher and to acquiring pets, my offspring offer me
  adrenal “delights.” Turbulence is the norm in a home full of
  teenagers. Accordingly, it is to their merit that Mom’s on a
  remarkable, creative journey!</p>
