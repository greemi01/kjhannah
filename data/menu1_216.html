<p>It was not so much that my unusual “kin” are astronomically wealthy
as it is that they have been striving to create the illusion that the
profits, which they engineered in space, ought to become the basis
for my family’s purse strings. As gelatinous beasts or antiquated
robots, though, those “dear ones” are unable to resist my censorship
of their suggestions.</p>

<p>Viscous and mechanical relatives aside, I’m grateful for my flesh
and blood. Equally, I’m appreciative that I can employ narrative to
separate moments from their environments and to ease such instants
into larger montages. To wit, this second volume of <em>Granny Does It</em> is
concerned with my interactions with my loved ones and with the many
collusions that occur in some of my other relationships. </p>

<p>Consider, for example, a happenstance of decades ago, that occurred
at a New Jersey university, when I taught Feminist Sociology. The
young women enrolled in my course couldn't believe that I posited that
they were not optimally invested in their bodies or that elderly women
liked sex. </p>

<p>In answer, I employed some rhetoric vestiges. More exactly, I urged
my students to become careful about their carnal activities, to gain
possession of the labels with which they and other people spoke of
their bodies (e.g., one of their assignments was to see <em>The Vagina
Monologues</em>), to grow cautious about the ways in which they displayed
themselves (another of their assignments was to refrain from wearing
scanty clothing for two weeks), and to increase their willing to
consider sexuality as an enduring expression.</p>

<p>Although external causality is culpable for certain moral states,
and although randomness, not intention, might undergird collective
ethics, most manipulative techniques that exploit human
vulnerabilities are not arbitrary. Accordingly, I lectured at my
students. Hopefully, any resulting increase in their awareness
improved their young lives and, going forward, improved their midlife
and golden years.</p>

<p>In teaching those coeds about “real” intimacy, I synthesized
thoughts with them about how bodies and relationships change with age
(at the time, I was regarded as “old” since I was in my early 40s.)
Yet, in the course of one such talk, a young lady burst out, “I can't
believe <em>Granny does it!</em>” She and her peers had never heard of the STD
epidemics that rage through nursing homes or of the fact that
oldsters, too, like to groove (rickety joints don’t dispel desire;
they merely compromise the number of viable positions.) </p>

<p>Whether we’re grannies, moms, or daughters, or their male
associates, we benefit from rethinking “womanly ways,” specifically,
and, from claiming ownership of our stories, more broadly. The seventy
essays in this volume of <em>Granny Does It</em> illuminate how feminine
distinctiveness necessarily impacts our interpretation of
relationships, professions, and overall society. This book’s essays
counsel that “womanliness,” especially as made manifest in grannies,
never goes out of fashion.</p>
