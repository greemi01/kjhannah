<p>Our accounts about fashioning texts might begin with remonstrations
about existence and only thereafter morph into duets between memories
and realizations. We, as a society, have become accustomed to shaping
words for reasons of profit, of promoting ideas, or of getting our
jollies. Given the prevalence of eBooks, writing has again become a
popular pastime.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, no matter the extent to which or the frequency with
which we romanticize our assembling of pages, there remains much about
this act that is gritty. First of all, our practices, when uniformed,
fall short of guaranteeing that we have created actual
literature. Second, our habit of utilizing unnecessary prescriptions
makes for much weak tea. Third, even our well composed treaties are
often not commercially lucrative, while our balderdash results in
flashes of fame. Today, there exist so many factors that influence the
relative success of a printed product that, even when engaging in new
strategies, we're not guaranteed good outcomes.</p>

<p>As such, it behooves us writers, whether we are inspired by
glassblowers, by health food store clerks, or by glorified academics,
to yield a little and to exert a lot. Except for the singular moments
when our intellectual epiphanies sound like rain over the Okavango
River or create visions akin to those of the swarms of butterflies in
the Sahyādri, we are advised to be humble regarding our understandings
of the publishing industry. Simply, if we get a project to market,
we've accomplished something; if not, it benefits us to think about
reframing our pitch.</p>

<p>Our attempts, both ordinary and irregular, to refine/redefine
ourselves, our writing, and our relationship to our writing, like
U-boat maneuvers that force submerged ships through many repetitions
of gyrations, might result in meeting our ends or might only churn
water. In balance, without such twists and rolls, it's unlikely that
we'll ever be able to proclaim, "yup, got one!"</p>
